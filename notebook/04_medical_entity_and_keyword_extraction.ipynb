Yeah   initially   example   II tried conventional small pigtail seven French pigtail   happened soon entered ejected left ventricle   um changed uh uh uh technique II use time uh first intention   NF four guiding capture uh provides us support order deliver ri wire ventricle   see   uh time enough support   maybe   work   position   nice trick shared us Nico definitely getting enough support   able exclude safari   safari small   Sometimes challenge   um say really like team French guarding     next step   balloon   selected balloon pre dilate   septum   going 14 millimeter balloon make sure enough room advance uh uh sepi free device   maybe show us   inter atrial septum view   want either short axis bike     one good confirm balloon really across atrial septum   looks like   Yeah   seems appropriate position   really like cases go gal inflation locate uh   waste balloon   Yeah   see like apply prolonged inflation sometimes recoiled septum   Yeah   make sure enough dilation   8 10 uh atmospheres   nothing extremely aggressive gentle prolonged predilation septum keep open uh uh th sometimes also make small push pull movements across septum balloon inflated order really   really stretch   Ok   think good   insert valve   uh mentioned   SAPIEN free 29 millimeter according sizing done   Um comments maybe familiar transcatheter mitral valve   procedure   valve crimped opposite direction compared respect flow coming left atrium towards left ventricle   see sitting skirt cy free crimped   directed towards distal tip capture   opposite direction   OK   uh second important point   Nico dealing mitral uh uh valve want flex appropriate uh direction   Uh keep mind remind rotate clockwise   uh delivery handle make sure bend towards mitral valve   side   Remember Edwards po po pointing upwards mitral side   point downwards uh 180 degree rotation   OK   Good   Let proceed   another issue gon na face potentially see fluoroscopy   Nico fact may uh need     need find proper location uh uh align um stent frame yeah   onto balloon   sometimes happened   inside   shift   one option see   nose already   Uh contact septum   think   Yeah   option slide back shift currently order uh uh make   process free uh make     alignment little bit easier   Ok   Ok   proceed alignment   Ok   Nico   let uh   Uh uh let uh try pull back balloon   pay attention keep wire position   gradually push back keep left ventricle   even fine tuning alignment   keep wire place pushing regular basis     OK   Thank   Uh let come back uh objective cross septum valve   think start steer little bit like   basically foil adapt level steering     stiff wire asks exactly   words     follow   stiff wire   see   across septum   Yeah   Yeah   located directly towards uh post   one posts   Yeah   maybe work little bit   Uh time go back   let compensate position   see uh OK   Collaborative maneuver two operators   maybe let withdraw           flex   Yeah   Yeah   cross side   Yeah   cross     maybe get better push   OK   think better   Yeah     pull slightly stiff   let see cross   OK     engaging little bit   OK   let flex   Yes   see   always uh   work flex um   think uh interesting uh uh observation   First   collaboration two operators   Yeah   definitely uh keep wire place proper uh proper position   Second   need may flex much   order avoid lose pushability order cross septum   difficult valve protected sheath   Yeah   direct friction frame valve across septum   uh across septum   add flex follow   stiff wire drives towards correct uh location   Exactly   uh preparing uh direct wire pacing system   uh usually use HIV procedures   added fusion uh vision   ideal location valve deployed   Um Basically   summarize fact want ventricular side   uh     frame uh SAPIEN free uh located around   level uh landmarks   meaning words maybe 1 5 uh uh SAPIEN valve   would actual side   ii think ideal uh ideal location   would say   uh order uh target uh position   would   would position initially   guess need uh slightly back biopro   going keep wire position   slightly pushing wire keeping top stent frame close     highlights   OK   uh provide us appropriate position   uh discrepancy uh highlights uh uh free   stent free   Uh something uh may work bit uh keeping uh play   playing wire   catheter bit perpendicular   OK   something sometime improve um um pulling little bit     order less rigid part   atrium push stiff wire push also side   co going good way start   uh going see deployment   important go slowly   Yeah   way may reposition everything   OK   going position right hand distal tip capture   pushing order stable reference left ventricle   hand   holding delivery capture case make uh either advancements pull back man   going adjust deployment uh going inflate slowly   let go 180 basing   OK   good regarding capture pressure   Ok   Ok   stop   Yeah   gently   Currently   pushing stiff wire order prevent diving ventricle   position stable   Ok     ok   let fully inflate   Yeah   deflation   Ok   pacing   pacing   Ok   deployment uh sequence maybe let spend   let review yeah   seconds review     commenting   slow deployment   first operator maintain strong push stiff wire order hold position place put maximum volume   see compared initial target uh fusion   positioning   think looks good maybe withdraw balloon confirm everything ok   used sometimes add 12   post dilate order flare ventricular part se valve order improve correct deployment mitral mitral position   Ok   obvious conduction disturbance patient pacemaker withdraw balloon   Ok   gon na flexing little bit allow uh la assess outcome   still suffering inside uh going withdraw pigtail capture seconds   think important echo images eyes   Yeah   maybe comment outcome   OK   valve good position   see new leaflets using color Doppler   Yeah   absolutely regurgitation   trace uh inside valve perivalvular regurgitation   Georgia     wire anymore
