zwei Stühlchen B ja noch mal ein bisschen auf das der zieht wieder hier luft musste wenn er ein bisschen reinmachen dass das Ventil nicht offen ist Danke wird sie den ersten entstehen Die Sorry bitte einmal kurz ja das eine ist bei der i Sonde oder ja ich hab gesehen habe ich glaube ich da direkt es ist gar nicht schlecht aus ja ich komm nach kannst du ein bisschen zurückgehen genau ich rae dich war schon ganz schön tief drin gewesen ne nö ne das ist da oben sehr schön sieht schön aus da kann man so einen kleinen tipp hier auf 31 Du sagst wenn du Bescheid hier wirkt ein bisschen schief Vielleicht 3123 oberes gelb rock nicht so schön ne sie mal ein bisschen zurück ob der dann ich glaube nicht dass das mal ich mach mal ganz auf wobei ich eigentlich kaum ein bisschen counter oder so ja hab ich gerade gekauft oder mach 31 23 ja wenn ich pushe wird's eigentlich nicht so richtig besser hab ich das gefühl ja der rock zu hässlich nicht schön nicht schön wir können ja noch mal versuchen ich rocke ob wir den doch tiefer machen den er nimmst du da ein bisschen vor und wenn du mit der schleuse noch ein bisschen näher geht nicht ich drück komme ich drück schon jetzt noch mal so ein bisschen counter vielleicht schau mal ja wir sind ja ja ja dann können wir noch mal auf 3123 er ist schlechter ist schlechter ne auch das ist jetzt der untere ast da kannst du jetzt mal reinstopfen hinterher aber er dann stabiler ist ja vielleicht ist es besser warte mal noch mal hier in sie könnte könnte besser sein als so 123 geht trotzdem recht einfach rein Das kann wenn ich ehrlich bin kleine Vene Das ist so klar Zwischendurch war es am besten im Oberen mit ein bisschen weniger Puh so war meine ja ich nehm mal ein bisschen den Pusch raus geh noch mal zurück dann kannst du noch mal einen oberen ja ist der untere wieder ja da der ist noch nicht oben nicht nicht zieh zurück ein bisschen das ist oben Ja ich lass den jetzt mal da drin gesteckt noch mal hier mit ein bisschen weniger puh 123 Gar nicht so gar nicht oddi ist da Wasser drin hast du Wasser O gut scheiße sorry die ganze zeit gewohnt also gar keine noch mal 3123 falsch nachgetan weil ich falsch angeschlossen habe nee scheiße der untere ast war mir ist aber besser als der untere los machen neue Test genau den zieh mal ein bisschen zurück du kannst auf 3123 ist ein bisschen besser Na ist nicht optimal da kippt er ab Willst du mal versuchen ob du noch ein Händchen hast das gerne versuchen Untere aste vielleicht noch mal wirklich für sie hatten ja beim unteren ast nur nur na eigentlich ganz gut Nee ja ja noch nicht ganz ich fand den den find ich schon besser irgendwie auch zumindest vom winkel denkt man dass er besser wäre nochmal gucken 123 verdreht doch wie der dreht dieser plus mode ist hat es auf jeden fall schlechter gemacht finde ich jetzt habe ich mich irgendwie rein gerockt 123 Nicht wundern der hintere ist der ding es vertauscht km und ja ja hab ich gesehen ist nichts der wahnsinn der drückt sich raus ist zu groß Ja ich mach ihn ja wieder klein da glaube ich ein bisschen zurückziehen dann kann ich dir was geht da auf der muss aber weiter rein der schiff bitte ja sieht eigentlich gar nicht schlecht aus 123 das beste was wir glaub ich erst mal 123 es kann ja aber das machen wir so haben wir diese signale signale steht auch noch so ein bisschen ich habe gerade noch mal ein bisschen nachgegeben Ja ist auch ein Stuhl nach der dekade wird hier nicht vergessen Ja da noch aktuell frieren wir die linke obere Einsatz verlauf Guck mal ja er hat halt kleine Wehen ja furchtbar wirklich kleine Oma eine so mal so ne nicht so richtig perfekte Kryo macht so eklige Sprünge hin und her Was eigentlich noch mal die gleichen Hebel Ja ja jetzt gut lass mal so 47 Jetzt ist er gerade gefallen ja ein bisschen gepusht und der ist nur den ballon gepusht ballon gepfuscht und ja ich weiß nicht ob da 34 man sieht's nicht mehr gut ne aber das scharfe sinken heißt auf jeden fall nicht mehr zu sehen minus 48 haben wir immerhin nimm's doch gleich mhm bei dem letzten roland wollte auch hat gemeint wir hätten ihn rufen sollen ich weiß hat er mich auch noch mal drauf hat er auch noch mal gesagt ja ja ja klar am ende müssen wir gerade divertieren das werden alle dran denken es ja das ist scheiße die schleuse so wobei man denkt jetzt drückt er so ein bisschen nach oben da wo das cap war Ja deswegen hatte ich den so ein bisschen hoch versucht zu drücken Aber schleuse steht ja super schön eigentlich ne Was macht er jetzt Ach so ist an geh du an dich oder klar gerne ich hoffe dass wir die aber einfach kann ja jeder ne dieses einpacken von dem hier ist eine kleine Wissenschaft für sich Ich hab heute meine Premiere gehabt gesehen Team Pflege Wir haben Daten durchzugeben LSV 180 Sekunden Freest Tour minimal Temperatur minus 51 Grad keine Isolation suffer 34 Grad muss man sagen ist Signal Also ich wollte in Defla ja ich wollte ein bisschen rausziehen der war aber zu weit ich konnte nicht verletzt werden Kannst du mal kurz leuchten Ich weiß nicht bei ihm okay ans ostium legen frage ist da ist nichts das ist das ich würd den einmal gern wie so eine schlange so eine klingel hinlegen Ja genau jetzt haben wir einen klingel da haben wir da warte da ist da ist das nicht ne das ist das ist l a am ehesten da ist er nicht da ist isoliert in der vene und dann oder lassen sie den unteren ast einmal noch probieren Ich komme einmal hinterher mit der Schleuse und beug ein bisschen ist der unter da geh noch mal zurück kannst ja noch mal gleich wird denn hier hin gesetzt der das ist der untere ja auch die unterscheidet zwischen zwei Sprachen und Macht dann den Befund auf deutsch ist das macht viel besser das ist es auf 312 Das ist er Clues des Jahrhunderts war vorhin unser unser was gemacht schön ah Yes aber so ein kleines Ding guck dir das an sorry war ja gerade sehr konzentriert auf mir macht nichts weißt du was meinst du Nee ich frag nur ob das wenn das ki gesteuert nachher dieser Befund geschrieben wird Er kennt die auch zweisprachig also zwischen Englisch und Deutsch unterscheidet die und schreibt dann trotzdem oft Ich frag nur Ja weiß ich nicht wahrscheinlich hoffentlich muss also das kann ich dir noch nicht sagen wir sind okay ja ja schön schön soll wir hochmachen Zweiter Freese auf der LSV bei erstem Free Keine Isolation deshalb Zweiter Freese l PV 180 Sekunden Dor Ösophagus Temperatur 34 Grad Keine Isolation Zuzeit bei tiefer Lage des minimale Freest Temperatur folgt 13:43 Uhr haben wir es Zweiter Freese LSV vergessen mich nicht die wird nämlich abgeholt von der Freundin zum Geburtstag sie ist aber der wird einfach auch dadurch dass der Ballon so viel im Vorhof ist wird da nicht so super kalt Ja eine Mega Olu weg jetzt meine Töchter und meine Frau die haben solche Launen Es gibt Tage da sind ja alle richtig gut drauf gestern haben die alle eine gute Laune Tablette und ich komm nach Haus alle und o papa und auf Asche und am Tag vorher ich komme noch rain oder den ganzen Tag sind die so furchtbar drauf Ich bin nur das spricht mich nicht an Keiner wollte mehr reden alle haben nur geheult geschrien und geweint Und was ich sag was ist los vor euch Gestern hattet ihr alle eure Tage wirklich und heut so extrem also das ist schon also krass dass dann alle mith team pflege ja minimale free temperatur minus 54 grad die sind gefühlt jetzt schon synchronisiert auch wenn die kleinen noch viel zu klein dafür sind Aber abgefahren ist bleiben auch lange lange auftauche sehr um sieben ist das jahr danach Wir machen da ein ganz lustiger vorwurf hier absolut rangi zieh noch mal zurück Dann kam er zurück in zurück zurück Das sieht super aus so was von isoliert her okay ja ein bisschen runter bisschen nach Poster ja ja das ist der obere und auch ein bisschen hinterher ja ich zieh zurück ja warte noch nicht jetzt hier das ist Laura Brun Mittler Vielleicht geht es noch weiter da gibt es noch einen unteren Ich zieh mal ja hier ich bin mal ganz zurück und komm mal hier bleibt als dick Die zweite Ebene ist zuversichtlich Ja ich sehe das ist ein schmaler Grat Okay auf 295 ich mache sie hier vielleicht ein bisschen auf oder das ist glaube ich eher knickt den zack bisschen auf weil der untere Ast fehlt Vielleicht sehen wir den auch auf 3123 oh mega ha der Wilde ich würde ihn nicht zurückziehen ne ne ich bin steht noch drauf hier wie ist die Act 295 Ja ja jetzt Tibet kaufen wir sehr gut kannst die Rechten schon einstellen so sind ganz schön weit unten die untere voll weit aus also krass das sieht aus wie so ein Rochen wie so ein Sing Ray Ja ja krass super grob ja very in trust morphologie sie wir können mal stimmen gleich machen oder so ja ich wusste das zum Beispiel nicht dass bei dem crom support gebraucht wird und so weiter Was würden sofort heute morgen diese Aktion mit dem C wurde einem auch gleich ein Strick draus gedreht Ja ich hab na ja ist so aber man versteht es insofern auch als das wirklich kacke ist wenn du da natürlich dann stehst und keiner von dem op personal eine ahnung also ich find es schon beim schrittmacher nervig genug wenn du denen erklärst alleine wo was gedrückt wird wenn du dann ein ct hast ist das echt Ja verstehe ich sehr gut aber ich hab es noch nie als ich mir war nicht bewusst Aber julius hat die ja gestern umgestellt sag mal stimm start drücken steht noch gar capture na kauft ihm mal ein bisschen mehr dass er da bleibt Ja ja ja stopp der pech er dreht sich halt von selbst wieder muss immer ein bisschen mir hin arsch weggerutscht ein bisschen zahn ach ja das steht noch gut ist krass wie das k m wie sie einfach komplett stehen so da Ah es ist immer schade wenn man die anjos nicht schon mit der öz so so die so schön gebogen ist Liegt an der kann ich kann ich mich mal so schön orientieren weil man die untere ja gut sieht an den zwischenwirte finde ich so gleich soll ely p V Noch schnell weg sind noch geht's Y soll wir durchgehen Was meint sie Ach so sorry P L P V 180 Sekunden minus acht Grad minimaler keine Isolation sugus Temperatur minimal 30 Grad Es ist jetzt 13:51 Uhr Wir machen jetzt gleich weiter mit der R ipv ja zurückziehen is so was von isoliert ist der untere wahrscheinlich schon Oh ja muss so ein bisschen genau das okay mal gucken dass der winkel stimmt bisschen mehr kur kurve ja es kann gut sein Es kann gut sein das 35123 da ist nicht gut ausgedreht jetzt wird's warte mal wo ist der ska da wo war das gelb unten seitlich ne ein bisschen unten und ein bisschen zwischendurch sieht man wie sich da so weil ich steht da hier ganz schön rock da auch schon wieder da rockt er schon ein bisschen meinen dass man es da perfekt hat Also da könnte ich ihn mal noch ein bisschen pushen dann dann lockt er sich raus verrückt und lass noch einmal wir können ja mal versuchen wie es so ist und wenn es nicht ist dann mach ich ihn auf beim spülen 123 bei der Anschrift nein das ist Schau das noch jetzt und jetzt auch ja wir können auch den unteren Ast nehmen wenn es aussieht auch nicht ab jetzt steht nicht mehr sollen wir den unteren Ast nehmen Wie mach ich das mir Komm lass den unteren Ast Ja ich komme immer hinterher mit der Schleuse ich bin aber noch nicht mehr unter ne ich weiß ich wollte einmal den so ausrichten hier ja ich wollt nur die Schleuse so hinterher kommen so jetzt und jetzt hier ein bisschen weiter kurve hier vielleicht das ist aber ich zieh mal kurz zurück macht dir einmal noch mal die andere Ebene das ist der untere das wird ganz sicher besser sein Ja ja das wird gut steht jetzt schon einmal noch ausreichender ist das da okay Mal gucken auf 3123 wer ist in wert Vorsicht schau mal auf wenn wir mal ohne leuchtenden er auch noch den knick vielleicht draus machen in weil der da schon so diesen ja da genau das ist Es ist viel besser mal auf 3123 Es geht noch sehr leicht War war war so okay so alles gut ja jetzt noch mal 123 ja jetzt ist nicht tot ja auf drei es sind 23 ist gut ich zieh dann gleich auch noch will zurück zurückziehen Ja jetzt haben wir signal riesen signal Ich stand mit pech und ar captured ein super fällt erst mal gut pds an noch falls er nicht an ist nicht angemacht ja wer den runterziehen müssen gleich noch bisschen auf und runter ist mein gefühl dass er dann besser solange es geht ich brauche auch meinen tag frei also nee temperaturmässig fällt der da auch nicht wirklich aber wir sollten ihn einfach fallen lassen und zwei ich hab gleich ja bei 90 bringen wir ab abbruch okay abbruch rp bei 90 sekunden bei ich glaub weiß nicht ob jemand zu den adäquaten temperaturabfall abbruch ipv bei 90 sekunden bei minus 42 grad aufgrund keinem guten temperaturabfall fehlen isolation fehlen der isolation und keinem gut ab war die mittlere zwischendurch doch lass dir noch mal vorne ja tiefer drin für mehr support sagen wir dann bescheid das war die mittlere scheiße die ist jetzt ist er wieder hoch get durch das auf oder ohren die untere wieder die lassen die unter und manche das ist ein bisschen mehr Körben Ja ja mach ich mach ich mach ich ich richte mal aus ich hab das Gefühl er ist ein bisschen mehr Ja dass es unter war Haushalt wir haben ein Gefühl der zwei ist aber nicht zu viel was sie jetzt ja da ist zu viel schau mal nicht so ganz ja der rockt auch so weißt du öffnen ein bisschen was mein bisschen öffnen Die Schleuse habe ich gerade gemacht genau auf 3123 Ja es ist auch besser ich starte war auf 3123 Unten ist er auf jeden Fall gut od also insgesamt sehr viel besser als eben fand ich Also ich also radikal ist glaube ich auch stimmt da war ich irgendwie war da was da war was auf dem einen seit der ganz am ballon klebt oben war ein Schafe auf spiral 12 eine könnte auch noch was sein Ja ja ja capture ich teilweise ich glaub tatsächlich jetzt ist wenn das cap oben oder unten der abgang nach unten steht ja in Ella ohne ja ein bisschen aufmachen vielleicht ein bisschen ja also so gefühlt ein bisschen weniger 89 83 Das ist gut echt ne schwierige Vene Was sagt guck immer zur rechten unteren wir sind das buch aber hier ein bisschen mehr da ich sie direkt jetzt meine mutter auch heute jetzt noch hier das ordentlich push aber und sie ändert eigentlich nicht wirklich was ne wird es jetzt lassen ist eine kleine wee schau mal mini aus wir können ja noch mal angucken Ja die ist mir nie der großteil des ballons hängt einfach raus Ja total verrückt ist krass es unpassend kleine enen zu diesem riesen kugel vorhof wirklich ist wirklich wahr so ein cartoon ja was witzig ist wenn du da die rechten und die linken die rechten in einem ring applaudiere dazwischen diese riesen karin also das ist ja kilometer also eigentlich ist das kleine ding kann sie kann gelaufen sein koma minus 44 liegt einfach daran dass das ding das ding ist Genau der ganze ballon ist eigentlich im wurf und umspült aber schön war die inklusion an der eroberung das hast du schon gemacht Ja gott sei Dank das war ist ja auch die wirklich wichtige ne denke ich pflege ipv minus 45 grad 180 Sekunden sopha 33 grad Keine Isolation oder time to isolation mach mal 12 sekunden isolation seit 12 sekunden das war der zweite freese of ab Ich wollte nur den Pusch ein bisschen rausnehmen weil ich da noch die Schleuse so dran hatte Ja ganz draußen jetzt kannst du ja ist ja schon von damals ich habe auch keine krass steht ganz steil ne 12 sekunden ist das denn scheiße Ja das mach ich ja 12 sekunden kannst wieder zurückgehen ja ist dann den scheiß was ist er dreh gleich mal aus Jetzt jetzt schon austreten die schleuse noch mal mehr mehr in die richtung dass du genau dahin guckst in la ich rail ich krass ich es ist der wahnsinn wie der er der springt da das ist ein ganz schmaler Grat Wahnsinn wirklich Also das ist ich schau mal von aus dass du da bist du weißt das ist wirklich das septum was mich da so ich ich wenn ich weiter man will ja denken man muss mir klo aber dann springt er raus das habe ich eben nicht deswegen wäre das jetzt hier schon irgendwie eine ja genauso so Schau mal da der wird dir gleich raus puschen das geht nicht glaube ich hi ein bisschen mal da vorne er klopft wieder raus dass man ein bisschen weiter vorne aufpumpt das habe ich nicht verstanden vorne auf wenn man weiter in der Vene aufpumpt Ach so ein tiefer Rhein so jetzt hast du den defla Nee der ist von selbst definiert ich habe nichts gemacht tatsächlich ich weiß nicht was das war ich habe den jetzt tatsächlich ein bisschen tiefer reingeschoben Guck mal ja wird er in der Vene aufpumpen ist dein werden es ist echt chilly shit alter ich weiß überhaupt nicht was ich ja ja ja ja ja guck mal nach letzter schrei auf 3123 es fehlt komplett Ja ich weiß ich seh's die Kurbel ja genau kurve so ist gut so wird's gut so wird's gut ist krass in der ebene denkt man total geil und in der anderen mal schauen ob das was wird probier also wir können auch einmal da kannst du auch gern noch bei 123 er drückt aber was also wenn ich wenn ich hier so drehe wie man denkt ich müsste drehen ne Glocke dann ist es kurz vor dem Aussprung jetzt gleich hört er mich raus ich muss nur minimal noch dringen Gleich springt er so jetzt hat man das gefühl hier könnte es klappen Eis kurz vorausspringen okay Nummer 3123 schon ein bisschen besser ne ja ähm also ich dreh jetzt noch einen mikrometer und vielleicht floppt der okay hier komm an 123 lass uns den frieren so wenn ich jetzt den zurückziehe 12 kleines stück vielleicht ja drei ja guck das war's ja haben wir rausgedrückt noch ein stück komm ja hab ich gerade cool ja wir haben sogar ein signal gut jetzt muss er auch die auf und wird länger sogar vreni capture nich nee der ist zu weit Wir haben wir runtergezogen da da ich zuckte ja ich glaube das eine signal ist auch da oben wird es immer so ein bisschen länger zockt so was von 53 so eine schwierige anatomie minus 56 mann was ist das denn Das kann doch nicht sein ernst sein dass da nichts passiert Kannst du mir das mal erklären Ist es ich bin mir nicht sicher ob am anfang was weggefallen ist da war dieses Krisselig und ob das nicht weil das ist ja das ist ja also das ist ja für seinen Wurf der Besten zeig mal wo 12 ist ja nur 12 ist schon seltsam barry minus 60 mann ja also das funktioniert nicht wenn man da nicht kann auch noch mal hier irgendwie wird länger ne aber es wird länger Also kann man nicht verheimlichen dass das pv signal sein muss Rufen wir noch mal die andere richtung crazy wenn die schleuse ein bisschen zurück den ballon jetzt vorort ja schleuse zurück im ballon vor gepuscht Alter charlotte was ist das Bin mir nicht sicher er ist schon langsamer als der rest Das kann man nicht leugnen law chans so ist schon fertig Willst du mal stimmen stopp machen aber sieht so crazy aus oder mit dem septum da in der also tja Ziel ist könnt ihr einmal notieren r s v 180 sekunden minus 65 grad sugus temperatur grad keine Isolation können ja gleich einmal trotzdem aber in der i vor und zurück nur gucken aber das signal ist schon sehr auffällig vor allem ist länger geworden vor ewige aufbauphase ist das wir können auch ah weißt du was wir grade vertieren da in der Vene und schauen im Sinus ja sehr gut würden wir könnten wir gleich einmal divertieren aber man nur dass der jetzt nicht völlig schief steht genau wie ich dachte ist schon eingegeben Guck mal der ist hart rausgegangen ich ziehe den Satz zurück und einmal gucken bist du da in rao gut drin Ja okay voll drin wir karte vertieren einmal mit 200 bitte geladen georg sind und einmal unter rückzug im das ist sind wir im Vergleich zu unserem genauen ostium mal tick tiefer dass man einmal weiß okay wo bist du da in der wenig wenn du vor schiebst kommst du rein Ja da ist weg wenn man sich die ano anguckt Schon mal genau am übergang oder wo sollen wir noch mal drauf sitzen Was denk ich mal bitte zähne das sieht doch schon verdächtig aus soll ich immer noch gerne sehr gerne weiß aber auch nicht mehr hätte auch nicht besser wenn hier nicht er hat vergessen Ja das hat viel zu tun Ich weiß es ist ja in flattieren ja schlechtes gefühl nicht darum hatte ich aber auch hatte ich aber schon War ja richtig das erste wurde ja nie abgegeben das war ja nur gesagt das wurde abgegeben Mhm schon egal ja es geht ja darum dass man sagt es ist abgegeben und wartet noch nicht Ja du sagst mir machte auf ansage er hat hier schon diesen rocky knick das sauste auch nicht so viel enttäuschender ja in der vene und dann kommt der knick ich kann ein bisschen in den chief vielleicht nicht so rein Sorry ich dachte weil wir eben da so einen erfolg mit hatten Sorry ne lass ihn mal tief drin jetzt ja genau wir haben ja nur im letzten moment als wir dann als er schon angefroren war ja nochmal in flat zack ist er im unteren auf die flattieren ich glaube wir lassen es ja ja ich glaube es ist einfach eine so ne das ist so unklar Zieh mal zurück zurück zurück zurück sieh mal raus ne gott ja gut fertig Ja kann ich sagen strahlung geht aus achtung röntgen ist deaktiviert Oh was für eine anatomie es war echt ali an Dafür muss man sagen das ist eigentlich schön gefroren ne also auch mit der temperatur und so das heißt die temperatur ist eigentlich so 63 Grad also tief ist sie isoliert Aber du hast schon recht das Signal war ein bisschen verdächtig haben wir Kontrastmittel gabe gemacht Ja 60 toll so super danke schön zu gleich an der Fernbedienung immer zehn danke schön ist freier noch da Ja ja ja ich wollt den ballon sehen oder ah ja freier geht gucken beim ballon sehr gut charlotte heftig guckst du noch Das hat strand als sigo haben wir noch nicht alles entspannt sind auch meine absoluten lieblings prozeduren mit charlotte hier muss ich immer wieder bitten macht wirklich Spaß Sir wir inflation der bana ja und jetzt wird gefroren Wer von euch hat denn jetzt weihnachten Also montag nicht mehr eike weihnachten und wir sehen uns montag so Gott will andere und jetzt hast hier dein Eisklumpen schleusen ex 14:15 Uhr geht da rein und 14:7 uhr Wieso ja der liegt an der Lungen Behne setzt liegt an der Lungenvenen an Das liegt in der Lungenvenen dieser Spiral um die Signale abzugreifen und der wird hinterher gestopft an die Lunge heran gedrückt stoppen noch mal stoppen dann siehst du wie das hier so und im Herzen hast du natürlich da das Blut da friert es nicht so krass aber du hast schon das Kontrastmittel das dann außen rum noch steht Teilweise ist ja cool

Look, you can just step out a bit. Push forward, I think. It hits a little bit in front and then pumps up. Got it, front vein for pumping. It goes pretty deep into the Rhine. Deflated, nope, defined well actually. A little bit deeper inserted. Look, vein pumping, really cold, shit, I know, I can see it, crank it up, it's good, it's good, really cool. Just thinking, really great, check it out, you can try 123, press and turn. thinks should turn a bell with short offset, same hears out minimal enters Should jump feel flip ice short offset okay number 3123 already a bit better yes uh turn micrometer maybe will flop okay come 123 let freeze pull back 12 small piece maybe yes three yes look's yeah pressed piece come yeah straight cool yeah even signal good longer even Vreni capture no yeah tucked down a little, zipped yes believe signal on top always a tiny bit longer plays 53 difficult anatomy minus 56 man something is happening can you explain for sure at first it fell off messy yeah yeah yeah throw best show me 12 already pretty strange barry minus 60 man it works sometimes longer anyway hide the pv signal call to direction crazy slip a little back balloon suburb yes sluice back balloon pushed age charlotte already surely slower rest deny law chans already finished want to check pitch stop looks crazy septum yeah goal could note r s v 180 seconds minus 65 degrees sugus temperature degrees isolation yes same anyway i look back signal already noticeable longer become eternal construction phase ah you're currently looking vein look sinuses yes good could same divertieren völlig schief completely went wrong steht genau dachte schon eingegeben it was exactly what I thought, already typed it in Guck mal hart rausgegangen look, it came out hard ziehe Satz zurück gucken I'll pull back the sentence to check rao gut drin roa good in there Ja okay voll drin Yes okay totally in there karte vertieren 200 card divert 200 bitte geladen georg please loaded georg rückzug Vergleich genauen retract comparison exact ostium mal tick tiefer ostium, mark it a bit deeper weiß okay know okay wenig schiebst kommst rein a little you push come in Ja ano anguckt Yes ano looks Schon mal genau übergang sollen mal drauf sitzen Already exact transition should be on it denk mal bitte zähne sieht schon verdächtig think please teeth already look suspicious knows more would have made better forget already do knows already gets already says already waits already say make announcement already got there already rocky bent went faster more disappointing already vene comes bend little chief maybe in there Sorry thought that already success Sorry no let me deep in already right already last one moment already frozen yeah let me flatten again zack flatten the bottom believe me just believe a little unclear pull it back a bit pull it back pull it back pull it back take a look outside oh my god yeah okay done Yeah say exposure going attention X-ray deactivated Oh anatomy really Ali Actually that's pretty much frozen temperature means temperature actually 63 degrees deep isolated you're right signal a little bit doubted contrast medium given yes 60 great awesome thanks very much same remote control always ten thank you great free yeah yeah want to see a balloon oh yeah free go look at the balloon good charlotte really looking beach sigo relaxed absolutely favorite procedures charlotte always asks makes really fun sir inflation banja yes frozen who christmas monday more eike christmas see monday God has ice cubes sliding in. At 14:15, it goes in. At 14:7, why does it lie? It lies because of lung parenchyma, and then it lies because of lung veins, which release spiral signals; afterwards they are stuffed. The lungs are pushed forward to stop them. Stop them once more, stop. You can see the heart; of course, it has blood. That's pretty cold. You've already got contrast medium outside; partly yes, cool. I'd like to have a nice piece of toast with butter. Charlotte, you could do better. Say P a in the bettel joyce: Herr, two days ago somehow it was a day with feet, be okay. You need to take one more thing, nice yes. It's Monday, should actually write a message. Hei Eike, can you please write an email? Heike Dettmann.\n"
