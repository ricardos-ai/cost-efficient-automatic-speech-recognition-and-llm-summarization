The limitation here is the vocabulary. Hwoever, we can see that many steps do include similiar words. This would have been better if lemminization was applied. We can see for example, that a step matching value positioning has a low score. However, the LLM returned mitral mitral position, which is even better with more description. this shows the limitation of not using stemming or lemmitization here, in that the scores are skewed. Overall, we can see that the key entities extracted are within a good range of semantic similiarity in most cases.
